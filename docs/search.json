My graduate research explores how diet shapes insect performance and life history, with applications to sustainable food systems and emerging biotechnologies. More broadly, I’m curious about how research in biology and physiology can apply to challenges from sustainable agriculture to future space exploration.\n\nConnect with me!\nYou can reach me at: sophiekasdorf@cmail.carleton.ca\nConnect on LinkedIn / [X] (https://twitter.com/)"
